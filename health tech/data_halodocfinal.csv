I used to get accurate diagnosis from doctors here even the ones who were still ""Free"" at the beginning. Now I can pay up to hundreds of IDR just to get rude doctors who just do not care, spend the 30 minutes only replying twice, or just do not know what is wrong with me.

Repeated generic responses such as ""semoga lekas sembuh"", ""GBU"" etc. She insisted that I need to consult to Puskesmas to get Isoman letter when I do not need one as I already granted isoman from my office.

Even the status was not clear, when I clicked to cancel, it said that there is a problem..and it kept saying that. So I called the CS, 3 times, because the chat bot is useless! I called CS to cancel my order but there was no progress until it was delivered after 4 days, I have bought from traditional drugs store. Such a waste!!!"

3,Feature to chat with doctor is great and the online medicine store is cool as well. My worst experience is in the booking for appointment with doctor. The schedule information is invalid (per information given by the hospital) and I cannot request for cancel by myself neither can the hospital staff.

5,This apps really helpfull during pandemic.. very easy to used!!
4,Simple n express n very helfulllll
1,Worst service ever. Halodoc is not ready to handle the cashless insurance facility of Manulife. The cashless is useless. You have to wait for more than 3 days to get Halodoc approval to approve your request for cashless facility for each medical request. The list of hospital cashless facility is also not entirely listed in the apps yet. There are still many insurance that can do far better than Manulife cooperation with Halodoc. Do not be deceived by this apps that offer cashless facility.
4,"Customer service is very bad. Every time i called them, they were busy."
5,"Nice dok, thanks"
5,Good enough to chat with the health specialist. Better than we search from google.CMIW
