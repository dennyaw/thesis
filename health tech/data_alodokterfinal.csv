2,I do not understand why this app cannot be opened?
5,I had an experience to consult with one of the general doctor. She is very responsive. Nice
5,Convenient and easy.
3,"Because of there is no payment system from the application itself, the price of the doctors can actually be more expensive than what Alodokter has inform, just like my experience where Alodokter told to pay only 75k, but when i actually want to pay after the consult, it rise up to 110k (100k/consult+10k admin fee). This is so embarrassing where at that time i only bring 100k and did not have more exchange, i hope this can be reviewed and changed in the future."

1,"Hii, need help. Please fix, per today since 18:30 on Redmi Note 8 Pro device, this apps does not work WHILE I am in the middle of PAID consultation with the doctors about my health concerns.... Previously re-install solved the issues, but suddenly it repeated and cannot be solved again even though i already reinstalled the apps. The notif pop-up said that there are not any internet connection, meanwhile I am opening other online apps are clearly fast and speed test the internet speed above 10Mbps"
5,God bless this application and all the doctors!
5,Very helpful app
4,"Kind Of disappointed with the system. When you look for the doctor, it was said that they are available.. but then after you purchased for consultation, it said that they are busy.. then after i wait for them to finish their session, they immediately went offline.. why cannot we consult first then pay? Or is there any other way so that we do not waste our time like that?"
5,Good and quick respon
5,Is this app only meant for Indonesia?am from Singapore trying to register but cannot Alredy tried to register with my email and phone number for verification but cannot ?
5,It is user friendly
1,"This is a scam app, do not even try. Do not let them have your phone number, more importantly do not let them know YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, they can autodebit/autocharge you even without your consent. Worse, they sell your data to third parties. They do all those WITHOUT your consent."

5,"Great apps, easy and believable!! You should download and get the lots information about your health from Alodokter!!"
4,"I find some good doctors. Will be better if we can edit review to doctor because some doctors did not reply and I give bad feedback, and find out they answer and having bad signal. The review box popped out before I can read the reply. So I feel bad for the review."
5,Easy to use. Useful for quick n simple consultation.
5,The best app
5,I got a fast response from the doctor
1,Useless and detrimental app! user money thief! using user data without permission and then taking money in the account at will.
